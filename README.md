# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter in Python

This Python script is designed to convert any word inputted by the user into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet. The script reads a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet, maps each letter of the alphabet to its phonetic code, and then converts words inputted by the user into their phonetic representation.
